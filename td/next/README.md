# WoT TD Next Resources

While the other folders contain the resources to be used in the Recommendation stage, during the development of new TD specification versions, such resources are not stable and are found in [the GitHub repository of the specification](https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description).
Thus, this folder only contains this readme that documents the URLs that are forwarded.

Currently, these resources are JSON-LD context, JSON Schemas for TDs and TMs and also ontology files.
